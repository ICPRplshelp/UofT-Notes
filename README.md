# UofT-Notes

This repository contains all the notes I've taken in-class that I've decided to make public.
**I make no guarantees with the correctness of my notes, so take them with a grain of salt. Hence, I'm not responsible if any mistake I make impacts you in any way.** If you find this repository useful, please give it a star.

## Current courses that are being updated

This repository will update between 6PM-1AM ET after each lecture. However, the amount of notes I take per course strongly depends on how it is taught.

Courses with a ⭐ beside it indicate that my notes for it are polished and more likely to be correct. This list is currently tentative as I don't know if the teaching style of the courses I'll take will allow me to take notes.

- TBA

## Past courses

Notes for courses I've taken in the past, which won't update other than minor changes:

- MAT223
- MAT137
- CSC236 ⭐
- CSC258 ⭐
- STA237 ⭐

These notes may not cover all the course material.


## Bugs

Sometimes, course notes may not match the course specified in the filename. If that occurs, that will be fixed the next time I update the files. You can always check the file history in this repository.


## About content

This repo **does not contain any work I've done that is for marks.** Most of the notes are in my own words, depending on the versatility I can word them.

You may use these notes for reference but **you may not copy stuff from these notes to any of your assignments.** Checkers are really good at finding things out.
