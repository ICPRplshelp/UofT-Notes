# UofT-Notes

This repository contains all the notes I've taken in-class that I've decided to make public.
**I make no guarantees with the correctness of my notes, so take them with a grain of salt. Hence, I'm not responsible if any mistake I make impacts you in any way.** If you find this repository useful, please share it or give it a star.

## Current courses that are being updated

This repository will update between 6PM-1AM ET after each lecture. However, the amount of notes I take per course strongly depends on how it is taught.

Courses with a ⭐ beside it indicate that my notes for it are polished and more likely to be correct. This list is currently tentative as I don't know if the teaching style of the courses I'll take will allow me to take notes.

- TBA

## Past courses

Notes for courses I've taken in the past, which won't update other than minor changes:

- MAT223
- MAT137
- CSC236 ⭐
- CSC258 ⭐
- STA237 ⭐

These notes may not cover all the course material.

## What is the best way to download these?

Here's a tutorial on how to download these notes and have them update with a push of a button. If you're experienced with `git` or the GitHub desktop app, you'll recognize these steps. This only works on Windows, though some Mac OS users may know how to get this to work on Mac OS.

1. Git clone this repository, **or** install Github Desktop, hit `<> Code`, and click on `local > open with GitHub Desktop`.

2. Either way, you'll be prompted to do some steps that will end up with this repository appearing on your computer. You can now freely access these nodes, but don't tamper with the `.pdf` files or the `.tex` files (as that will break the next step).

3. At any time, click on `pull_notes.bat` to update and resync the notes (this essentially does a `git pull`).




## Bugs

Sometimes, course notes may not match the course specified in the filename. If that occurs, that will be fixed the next time I update the files. You can always check the file history in this repository.


## About content

This repo **does not contain any work I've done that is for marks.** Most of the notes are in my own words, depending on the versatility I can word them.
