# UofT-Notes

This repository contains all the notes I've taken in-class that I've decided to make public. **These notes are constantly updating, so check on them often!**
**I make no guarantees with the correctness of my notes, so take them with a grain of salt. Hence, I'm not responsible if any mistake I make impacts you in any way.** If you find this repository useful, please give it a star. The amount of notes I take per course strongly depends on how it is taught.

If any instructor wants me to take any of these down let me know in the issues.

## Bugs

Sometimes, course notes may not match the course specified in the filename. If that occurs, that will be fixed the next time I update the files. You can always check the file history in this repository.


## About content

This repo **does not contain any work I've done that is for marks.** Most of the notes are in my own words, depending on the versatility I can word them.

You may use these notes for reference. However, please don't use them commercially or copy-paste anything from here into any of your assignments (I'm serious about this!!).

## Shell / batch files

If you ever clone these notes, run `_pullnotes.bat` (or `_pullnotes.sh` on macOS) to update them in one click.
