# UofT-Notes

This repository contains all the notes I've taken in-class that I've decided to make public. **These notes are constantly updating, so check on them often!**
**I make no guarantees with the correctness of my notes, so take them with a grain of salt. Hence, I'm not responsible if any mistake I make impacts you in any way.** If you find this repository useful, please give it a star. The amount of notes I take per course strongly depends on how it is taught.
 
## Current courses that are being updated


Courses with a ⭐ indicate that the notes are polished. 
These notes normally update **shortly after each lecture** 
unless said otherwise (typically immediately; usually 20 minutes; at most 12 hours excluding
exceptional circumstances).

- CSC311
- CSC343
- CSC209
- CSC263
- MAT235

These times are targets; they are not exhaustive and random circumstances can cause delays.

## Past courses

Notes for courses I've taken in the past, which won't update other than minor changes:

- MAT223
- MAT137
- CSC236 ⭐
- CSC258 ⭐
- STA237 ⭐

These notes may not cover all the course material.


## Bugs

Sometimes, course notes may not match the course specified in the filename. If that occurs, that will be fixed the next time I update the files. You can always check the file history in this repository.


## About content

This repo **does not contain any work I've done that is for marks.** Most of the notes are in my own words, depending on the versatility I can word them.

You may use these notes for reference. However, please don't use them commercially or copy-paste anything from here into any of your assignments (I'm serious about this!!).
